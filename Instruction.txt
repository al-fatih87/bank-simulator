Greetings from Muhammad Oyonumoh.

This is a Bank Simulator that simulates the banking system and operations, which includes
account opening, account balance check, deposit and transfers/withdrawals.
The aim of this Project is basically to create and manage your own bank at home.

This program works with MySQL database, which must be installed on your machine before running this program.

You must be connected to the installed database for the program to work properly. You may install xampp from the link
provided below, and start mySQL and Apache from the xampp application.

Get xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

After installation of xampp and running MySQL & Apache, run the Bank Simulator program. The first prompt asks if you
have created a database, enter "No", and the program will create a database. That's all. Enjoy!
